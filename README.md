The goal was to create a noise suppression model for real-life human audio.

The file `final_approach.ipynb` contains the final approach to the problem solved using spectral subtraction which uses Short Time Fourier Transform(STFT) and Inverse STFT to complete the process.

We were going to solve this using an alternate initial approach using neural networks which is showcased in `alternate_failed_approach.ipynb`. However, the lack of results in the approach forced us to move to the final approach.

We hope all your noise problems are solved. :)
